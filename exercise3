\section*{Introduction}
Hello world! This is my first document. 
In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an 
additional \$0.79 trillion to \$8.97 trillion,
which is approximately 68\% of GDP. As of October
4, 2008, the ``Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008`` raised the current debt ceiling
to \$11.3 trillion \citep{Song2016Low} % add \citep{} when adding a citation at the end of a paragraph
When I complete my work, I’ll have something to put here, but for now, I don’t have much. This is just a section holder. 
\section*{Some basic Math Stuff}
Using the \$ changes the way basic math looks in text. Let’s try an example starting here: Let a and b be distinct positive integers, and let c = a - b + 1. Now, let’s add the \$: Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive integers and let $c=a-b+1$.
Let’s play around with superscript and subscript. $y=c_2 x^2+c_1 x +c_0$
And we can use curly brackets to group superscripts and subscripts: $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ % you can also write the \$\$ as \begin{math} and \end{math} , just make sure you take out the \$
We can also use commands for Greek letters like $\mu$ and $\Omega$
If you would like to display an equation on it’s own line, use the command:
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}
{2a}
\end{equation}
\section*{More ``Advanced Math Stuff’’}
\citet{Zhou2016Mott} % adjust your language and use \citet{} at the beginning of a section.
Now we’re going to start using a new package that we’ve called in from the American Math Society called AMSmath. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
A & = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \\
% = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For this next equation, which is longer than one line, we’ll use the ``multline’’ environment.
\begin{multline*}
p(x)= 3x^6+14x^5y+590x^4y^2+19X^3y^3\\
-12x^2y^4-12xy^5+2y^6-a^3b^3
\end{multline*} % for more information on amsmath and these examples, visit https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Aligning_equations_with_amsmath#Introduction
