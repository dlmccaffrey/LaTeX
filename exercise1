\section*{Introduction}
Hello world! This is my first document. 
In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an 
additional \$0.79 trillion to \$8.97 trillion,
which is approximately 68\% of GDP. As of October
4, 2008, the ``Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008`` raised the current debt ceiling
to \$11.3 trillion. % quotation marks are made by using two back tics `` and two single apostrophes''
\section*{Section 1}
Once I complete the literature review, it will be quite long. I hope to have many citations. % note the asterisk after "section" - what does it do? Try taking it out. 
\section*{Section 2}
When I complete my work, I’ll have something to put here, but for now, I don’t have much. This is just a section holder.
