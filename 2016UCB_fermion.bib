Abstract = {{We investigate the generic features of the low energy dynamical spin
   structure factor of the Kitaev honeycomb quantum spin liquid perturbed
   away from its exact soluble limit by generic symmetry-allowed exchange
   couplings. We find that the spin gap persists in the Kitaev-Heisenberg
   model, but generally vanishes provided more generic symmetry-allowed
   interactions exist. We formulate the generic expansion of the spin
   operator in terms of fractionalized Majorana fermion operators according
   to the symmetry enriched topological order of the Kitaev spin liquid,
   described by its projective symmetry group. The dynamical spin structure
   factor displays power-law scaling bounded by Dirac cones in the vicinity
   of the Gamma, K, and K' points of the Brillouin zone, rather than the
   spin gap found for the exactly soluble point.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},

Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{The electroweak interactions of a strongly coupled gauge theory are
   discussed with an outlook beyond the Standard Model (BSM) under global
   and gauge anomaly constraints. The theory is built on a minimal massless
   fermion doublet of the SU(2) BSM flavor group (bsm-flavor) with a
   confining gauge force at the TeV scale in the two-index symmetric
   (sextet) representation of the BSM SU(3) color gauge group (bsm-color).
   The intriguing possibility of near-conformal sextet gauge dynamics could
   lead to the minimal realization of the composite Higgs mechanism with a
   light 0(++) scalar, far separated from strongly coupled resonances of
   the confining gauge force in the 2-3 TeV range, distinct from Higgsless
   technicolor. In previous publications we have presented results for the
   meson spectrum of the theory, including the light composite scalar,
   which is perhaps the emergent Higgs impostor. Here we discuss the
   critically important role of the baryon spectrum in the sextet model
   investigating its compatibility with what we know about thermal
   evolution of the early Universe including its galactic and terrestrial
   relics. For an important application, we report the first numerical
   results on the baryon spectrum of this theory from nonperturbative
   lattice simulations with baryon correlators in the staggered fermion
   implementation of the strongly coupled gauge sector. The quantum numbers
   of composite baryons and their spectroscopy from lattice simulations are
   required inputs for exploring dark matter contributions of the sextet
   BSM model, as outlined for future work.}},

Abstract = {{We construct a class of Abelian and non-Abelian local gauge theories
   that consist only of matter fields of fermions. The Lagrangian is local
   and does not contain an auxiliary vector field nor a subsidiary
   condition on the matter fields. It does not involve an extra dimension
   nor supersymmetry. This Lagrangian can be extended to non-Abelian gauge
   symmetry only in the case of SU(2) doublet matter fields. We carry out
   an explicit diagrammatic computation in the leading 1/N order to show
   that massless spin-one bound states appear with the correct gauge
   coupling. Our diagram calculation exposes the dynamical features that
   cannot be seen in the formal auxiliary vector-field method. For
   instance, it shows that the s-wave fermion-antifermion interaction in
   the S-3(1) channel ((psi) over bar gamma(mu)psi) alone cannot form the
   bound gauge bosons; the fermion-antifermion pairs must couple to the
   d-wave state too. One feature common to our class of Lagrangian is that
   the Noether current does not exist. Therefore it evades possible
   conflict with the no-go theorem of Weinberg and Witten on the formation
   of the non-Abelian gauge bosons.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate single crystals of Ce1-xNdxRhIn5 by means of
   x-ray-diffraction, microprobe, magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity,
   and electrical resistivity measurements. Our data reveal that the
   antiferromagnetic transition of CeRhIn5, at T-N(Ce) = 3.8 K, is linearly
   suppressed with x(Nd). We associate this effect with the presence of a
   ``Kondo hole{''} created by Nd substitution. The extrapolation of
   T-N(Ce) to zero temperature, however, occurs at x(c) similar to 0.3,
   which is below the two-dimensional percolation limit found in
   Ce1-xLaxRhIn5. This result strongly suggests the presence of a
   crystal-field induced magnetic frustration. Near x(Nd) similar to 0.2,
   the Ising antiferromagnetic order from Nd3+ ions is stabilized and
   T-N(Nd) increases up to 11 K in NdRhIn5. Our results shed light on the
   effects of magnetic doping in heavy-fermion antiferromagnets and
   stimulate the study of such systems under applied pressure.}},

Abstract = {{A Dirac nodal-line semimetal phase, which represents a new quantum state

   evidence of nodal-line fermions in ZrSiSe and ZrSiTe probed in de

   similar layered structure with ZrSiS, our studies show the Fermi surface
   (FS) enclosing a Dirac nodal line has a 2D character in ZrSiTe, in
   contrast with 3D-like FS in ZrSiSe and ZrSiS. Another important property
   revealed in our experiment is that the nodal-line fermion density in
   this family of materials (similar to 10(20) cm(-3)) is much higher than
   the Dirac fermion density of other topological materials with discrete
   nodes. In addition, we have demonstrated ZrSiSe and ZrSiTe single
   crystals can be thinned down to 2D atomic thin layers through
   microexfoliation, which offers the first platform to explore exotic
   properties of topological nodal-line fermions in low dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom in strongly
   correlated fermionic systems, in particular of Dirac fermions, is a
   long-standing problem in condensed matter physics. We investigate the
   competing orders in the half-filled SU(2N) Hubbard model on a honeycomb
   lattice, which can be accurately realized in optical lattices with
   ultracold large-spin alkaline-earth fermions. Employing large-scale
   projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we have explored
   quantum phase transitions from the gapless Dirac semimetals to the
   gapped Mott insulating phases in the SU(4) and SU(6) cases. Both of
   these Mott insulating states are found to be columnar valence bond solid
   (cVBS) and to be absent of the antiferromagnetic Neel ordering and the
   loop current ordering. Inside the cVBS phases, the dimer ordering is
   enhanced by increasing fermion components and behaves nonmonotonically
   as the interaction strength increases. Although the transitions
   generally should be of first order due to a cubic invariance possessed
   by the cVBS order, the coupling to gapless Dirac fermions can soften the
   transitions to second order through a nonanalytic term in the free
   energy. Our simulations provide important guidance for the experimental
   explorations of novel states of matter with ultracold alkaline-earth

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Particle-vortex duality is a powerful theoretical tool that has been
   used to study bosonic systems. Here, we propose an analogous duality for
   Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions. The physics of a single Dirac cone is
   proposed to be described by a dual theory, QED(3), with again a single
   Dirac fermion but coupled to a gauge field. This duality is established
   by considering two alternate descriptions of the three-dimensional
   topological insulator (TI) surface. The first description is the usual
   Dirac fermion surface state. The dual description is accessed via an
   electric-magnetic duality of the bulk TI coupled to a gauge field, which
   maps it to a gauged chiral topological insulator. This alternate
   description ultimately leads to a new surface theory, QED(3), which
   provides a simple description of otherwise intractable interacting
   electronic states. For example, an explicit derivation of the T-Pfaffian
   state, a proposed surface topological order of the TI, is obtained by
   simply pair condensing the dual fermions. The roles of time-reversal and
   particle-hole symmetries are exchanged by the duality, which connects
   some of our results to a recent conjecture by Son on particle-hole
   symmetric quantum Hall states.}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we focus on the interplay between geometry defects and
   topological properties in bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT)
   phases. We start from eight copies of 3D time-reversal (T) invariant
   topological superconductors (TSC) on a crystal lattice. We melt the
   lattice by condensation of disclinations and therefore restore the
   rotation symmetry. Such a disclination condensation procedure confines
   the fermion and afterwards turns the system into a 3D boson topological
   liquid crystal (TCL). The low energy effective theory of this
   crystalline-liquid transition contains a topological term inherited from
   the geometry axion response in TSC. In addition, we investigate the
   interplay between dislocation and superfluid vortex on the surface of
   TCL. We demonstrate that the T and translation invariant surface state
   is a double {[}eT mT] state with intrinsic surface topological order. We
   also look into the exotic behavior of dislocation in the 2D boson SPT
   state described by an O(4) nonlinear sigma model (NL sigma M) with
   topological Theta term. By dressing the O(4) vector with spiral order
   and gauging the symmetry, the dislocation has mutual semion statistics
   with the gauge flux. Further reducing the O(4) NL sigma M to the Ising
   limit, we arrive at the Levin-Gu model with stripy modulation whose
   dislocation has nontrivial braiding statistics.}},
